But what is this refresh button which doesn’t work ? Actually distribution contains all dev/debug stuff we don’t want for production, that’s why we removed the WEB-INF folder but we need to tweak things a little more :

edit the index.html file and remove the button (the ugly a tag)
remove the refresh.png file
edit the style.css file and remove all superdev classes.
Refresh the webpage, it should be better.
